<h1>Bug Buster AR</h1>

An AR experience built with Unity using Unity's AR foundation plugin and targeting ARKit / iOS platform. It is no longer on testflight.

Feature points and planes are constantly detected and adjusted in the scene via ARKit library and its visual inertial odometry algorithm. Simply adding the AR camera, then you can instruct the Unity engine like normal via C# scripts to interact with the physical surroundings. You can see bullet hole impacts on the walls. The spider is crawling on them. And the bullet impacts colliding with the spider result in destroying the spider game object. Possible future gaming could include multiplayer tactical games with life like simulation.

Unity version: 2020-3.8f1
